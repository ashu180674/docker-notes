Virtual Machine computer

A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). Software called a hypervisor separates the machineâ€™s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.

Docker is an open source containerization platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. It enables to package applications into containers that encapsulate source code, libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

Docker v/s virtual Machine
Virtual machine has its guest operating system above the host operating system, which makes virtual machines heavy. While on the other hand, Docker containers share the host operating system, and that is why they are lightweight.

The virtual machine does no share operating system, and there is strong isolation in the host kernel. Hence, they are more secure as compared to Containers. A container have a lot of security risks, and vulnerabilities as the containers have shared host kernel.

Docker containers are easily portable because they do not have separate operating systems. A container can be ported to a different OS, and it can start immediately. On the other hand, virtual machines have separate OS, so porting a virtual machine is difficult as compared to containers.

Containers are lightweight and can startup very fast compared to that of virtual machines,
